## Project Overview

<p>
  The <strong>Library Management System</strong> is a desktop application designed to help users manage a collection of books with ease. It provides features for adding, viewing, editing, deleting, and generating reports on books. The application offers a user-friendly interface developed using Java Swing, with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to ensure code structure and maintainability. Exception handling is integrated to manage errors effectively, and file writing is utilized to generate reports.
</p>

### Key Features:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Splash Screen:</strong> Engaging start-up splash screen with a loading progress bar.</li>
  <li><strong>User Authentication:</strong> Login and registration frames for user access control.</li>
  <li><strong>Book Management:</strong> Add, view, edit, delete, and search for books.</li>
  <li><strong>Report Generation:</strong> Generate textual reports and save them to a file.</li>
</ul>

## Technologies Used

<ul>
  <li><strong>Java Swing:</strong> For building the graphical user interface.</li>
  <li><strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> To maintain a modular code structure.</li>
  <li><strong>Exception Handling:</strong> For effective error management.</li>
  <li><strong>File Writing:</strong> To save book reports in a text file.</li>
</ul>

## Usage

<p>
  After running the application, you'll be presented with the splash screen, followed by the login interface. Here's a guide on how to use the system:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>Login/Register:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter your credentials to log in or click on the "Register" button to create a new account.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Add Book:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fill in the book details and click "Add" to save the book in the library.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>View Books:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Click on "View" to see a list of all books. Use the search functionality to find specific books by title.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Edit Book:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Select a book by ID, update the details, and click "Save" to apply changes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Delete Book:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Enter the ID of the book you wish to delete and confirm your choice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Generate Report:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Click "Report" to generate and save a report of all books in <code>LibraryReport.txt</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Exit:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Click "Exit" to close the application with a confirmation prompt.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

## Implementation Details

### Java Swing

<p>
  Java Swing is used to create the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application. It provides a rich set of components for building a responsive and intuitive user interface.
</p>

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

<p>
  OOP principles are used to enhance modularity and maintainability of the codebase. Here are some key classes:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>LibraryManagement</code></strong>: The main class implements <code>ActionListener</code> to handle user actions and manage the overall flow of the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>Book</code></strong>: A model class representing a book. This class encapsulates the book data and provides getter and setter methods.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong><code>BookTableModel</code></strong>: Extends <code>AbstractTableModel</code> to provide a custom data model for the JTable used in the application. This class manages the display of book data in a tabular format.
  </li>
</ul>

### Exception Handling

<p>
  Exception handling is implemented to ensure the application can manage errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong><code>IOException</code></strong>: This exception is caught when writing the book report to a file, ensuring the application handles file-related errors properly.
  </li>
</ul>

### File Writing

<p>
  File writing is used to create a textual report of all books and save it in a file named <code>LibraryReport.txt</code>.
</p>

## Project Algorithm

<p>
  Here's a detailed algorithmic overview of the project:
</p>

### 1. Splash Screen:
<ul>
  <li>Display a splash screen with the application's logo and loading progress.</li>
  <li>After a brief delay, the splash screen closes, and the login frame appears.</li>
</ul>

### 2. Login Frame:
<ul>
  <li>Display a login frame with fields for username and password.</li>
  <li>Users can log in or navigate to the registration frame if they don't have an account.</li>
</ul>

### 3. Registration Frame:
<ul>
  <li>Display a registration frame with fields for creating a new account.</li>
  <li>After successful registration, users are redirected to the login frame.</li>
</ul>

### 4. Main Application:
<ul>
  <li>Display the main <code>LibraryManagement</code> frame with a background image.</li>
  <li>Present form fields for book details (ID, title, author, publisher, year, ISBN, number of copies).</li>
  <li>Provide buttons for actions: Add, View, Edit, Delete, Clear, Report, Exit.</li>
</ul>

#### Add Book:
<ul>
  <li>Validate input fields and ensure numeric values for year and copies.</li>
  <li>Create a new <code>Book</code> object and add it to the book list.</li>
  <li>Clear input fields and display a success message.</li>
</ul>

#### View Books:
<ul>
  <li>Display a table with all books using <code>BookTableModel</code>.</li>
  <li>Allow searching for a book by title and display search results.</li>
</ul>

#### Edit Book:
<ul>
  <li>Prompt the user to enter a book ID to edit.</li>
  <li>Populate form fields with existing book details.</li>
  <li>Allow the user to modify details and update the book in the list.</li>
</ul>

#### Delete Book:
<ul>
  <li>Prompt the user to enter a book ID to delete.</li>
  <li>Remove the book from the list and display a success message.</li>
</ul>

#### Generate Report:
<ul>
  <li>Generate a textual report of all books.</li>
  <li>Save the report to a file and display it in a text area.</li>
</ul>

#### Exit Application:
<ul>
  <li>Prompt the user for confirmation before exiting the application.</li>
</ul>
